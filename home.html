    Welcome to <b>Phil Ranker</b>!

  </div>
  <div class="padded">

    This website will help you create personalized rankings of philosophy phd programs in the English-speaking world. All the data comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/">The Philosophical Gourmet Report</a>. (I own none of this data!) All this website does is customize the rankings based on which program specializations are important <i>to you</i>.

  </div>
  <div id="examples" class="padded">

    To demonstrate how the system works, take a look at the three examples below:

    <table id="ex">
      <tr>
        <td>

          Let's say I just want to see the un-customized rankings. (This will essentially reproduce the "Overall Rankings" section of tPGR.) <br/> <br/>

<textarea id="1">
us uk c a
overall 1
</textarea> <br/> <br/>

          This query says: "I would like to see all the rankings from the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia, and I only care about overall rankings." <br/> <br/>

          Press the button below to see the results. <br/> <br/>

          <button onclick="results(1)">Go!</button>

        </td>
        <td>
          
          Let's say I only want to see results is the US, and I care mostly about programs that are strong in philosophy of language and really strong in philosophy of mind, but I also care a little bit about the overall ranking of the school. <br/> <br/>

<textarea id="2">
us
lang 1.0
mind 1.5
overall 0.5
</textarea> <br/> <br/>

          This query uses the "lang", "mind", and "overall" keywords, which are hopefully self-explanatory. <br/> <br/>

          <button onclick="results(2)">Go!</button>

        </td>
        <td>c</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div id="results" class="padded hidden">

    We are currently showing results for the following query: <br/> <br/>

<textarea id="4"></textarea> <br/> <br/>

    The rankings with these settings are as follows:
